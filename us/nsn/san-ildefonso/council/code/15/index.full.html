                <p>The Council hereby finds and declares that the current process for members of the Pueblo to obtain ownership of a home through the Northern Pueblo Housing Authority ("NPHA") includes the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(a)">(a)</span> The Pueblo identifies a vacant parcel of land;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(b)">(b)</span> The Pueblo enters into a lease (the "NPHA Lease") with the Northern Pueblos Housing Authority, a federally recognized Tribally Designated Housing Entity ("NPHA") holding authorization from the Pueblos of Picuris, San Ildefonso and Tesuque tribes to obtain and manage Indian Housing Block Grant Program ("IHBG") funding from HUD covering the parcel of land on the Pueblo's reservation where the house is to be located (the "Subject Parcel"), recognizing that, at times, the NPHA lease may cover several parcels (a "master lease");</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(c)">(c)</span> Since the Subject Parcel is on the Pueblo's reservation, which is held in trust for the Pueblo by the US Government, the Subject Parcel is subject to federal law;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(d)">(d)</span> As provided by federal law, the NPHA lease between the Pueblo and the NPHA can only have a maximum term of 50 years (25 year initial term and a second 25 year term); At the end of the 50 year term, title to the Subject Parcel reverts to the Pueblo;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(e)">(e)</span> Using IHBG funding or other funds, the NPHA builds a house on the Subject Parcel covered by the NPHA Lease;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(g)">(g)</span> NPHA enters into an "Occupancy Agreement" with a member of the Pueblo (the "Acquiring Member") whereby the Acquiring Member: (1) obtains immediate right to occupy the house;  and, (2) if the Acquiring Member performs certain obligations over a specific term of time, the Acquiring Member will acquire the rights the NPHA has in the house;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(h)">(h)</span> Currently, when the Acquiring Member fully performs under the Occupancy Agreement, the NPHA transfers to the Acquiring Member all of the NPHA's right, title and interest in the house in the form of a quit claim deed;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(j)">(j)</span> The Pueblo wants the Acquiring Member to be able to occupy and treat the house 	as his or hers for a period of time longer than the term of the NPHA Lease;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(l)">(l)</span> There is also an issue as to whether the Pueblo's Governor had the legal authority from the Council to grant the right to occupy specific houses to previous Acquiring Members who had fully and completely performed under the Occupancy Agreement.</p>
